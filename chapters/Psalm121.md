## Psalm 121

### A Song of Ascents

1 I lift up my eyes to the hills.
    From where does my help come?
    
2 My help comes from the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth.

3 He will not let your foot be moved;
    he who keeps you will not slumber.
    
4 Behold, he who keeps Israel
    will neither slumber nor sleep.

5 The Lord is your keeper;
    the Lord is your shade on your right hand.
    
6 The sun shall not strike you by day,
    nor the moon by night.

7 The Lord will keep you from all evil;
    he will keep your life.
    
8 The Lord will keep
    your going out and your coming in
    from this time forth and forevermore.
